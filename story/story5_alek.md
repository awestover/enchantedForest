Azeala stood silent as Bob vanished into the distance. 
He didn't look back.
When she couldn't see Bob any longer she silently sank to the
ground, which was black and completely void of any living thing,
and quietly cried.

Mercury didn't give her the peace for long. 

"Come on" he said quietly, gently but insistently pulling her up.
"It's time to go."

Azeala was too tired to resist.
"Go? Where?" Azeala asked.

"I don't know," Mercury said "but we can't stay here."

"But Bob might come back" Azeala said desperately.

"If Bob comes back, he's not coming back to follow Rand's plan.
He's dangerous Azeala. For a moment, when you said Bob's name,
... did you see the look in his eyes? I thought he was going to
kill you. Plus, unfriendly creatures might be attracted by what
has happened here. We need to go."

"Where?"

"Let's go back to Mivoen, he will know what to do."

"Should we go bury Bucky?"

"There's no time. I don't really want to see his wound up close
either. If Bucky were here he'd understand."

They said their goodbys to Bucky from afar, and walked off.

They camped in a small grove of trees. The towering green
trees, and the beautiful colorful flora of the forest seemed
mocking. Azeala lay with her eyes closed, but could not sleep. 
What more can I do? How am I to help Bob on his journey if he
hates me and probably blames me for the death of his best friend.

Right before Bucky had rushed into the fight Bob was looking very
desperate. Azeala had wanted to help but knew that any help she
gave would probably only distract Bob and make it so that he had
to protect her.

When Bucky had ran out from his hiding spot Azeala could do
nothing to stop him.

Resigned to her restlessness Azeala decided to walk around.
*I guess I will go back to resisting Malimost in other ways.*
Walking among the trees in nearly complete darkness Azeala
wondered what she had done wrong. *Bob wasn't ready. I should
have seen that after Nodnull attacked us. If Kienan hadn't saved
them...*

*Maybe Bob is better off with Kienan to train him. He is really
an expert with Levancy.*
But no, Azeala trusted Rand. If Rand thought that Kienan was a
bad person, then that made him a bad mentor for Bob.

Azeala completed her walk, looping back to the location where she
had tried to sleep, and found Mercury awake also. 

She got back down and attempted to get some sleep.

They traveled on for a few days to Mivoen's house. He would know
what to do. He had to. Azeala wasn't sure what she'd do if he
said they had done all they could do.
Azeala would have chosen to spend the days in silence, but
Mercury refused to let her wallow in despair the whole time.
Although his cheerfulness was obviously largely fake, it still
managed to make Azeala feel a little less hopeless.

When they finally arrived back at Mivoen's house in the mountains
they found Mivoen outside of his house waiting for them. 

"Ho Mivoen!" Mercury shouted down to him, "how'd you know we'd
come?"

"Something very terrible has happened," Mivoen said.

They walked down to his house, and all entered so they could talk
more naturally.

"I'm sorry. We failed." Azeala said.

"No, I fear that this may have all been more sinister than a
failure on your part. I think this was planned by someone with no
good intentions." 

"It couldn't really have been," Azeala said.

"Anyways, please tell me what has happened. 
I felt a massive use of levancy 7 days ago. The levancy felt
tainted. I presume this massive pulse of Levnacy is why you are
here. I don't think Bob is dead though, that would have felt
different. Has Malimost captured Bob and Bucky? "

"Bucky is dead. Bob was the person who weilded the massive pulse
of levancy. After Bucky's death, and after getting the second key
from the Terioth Bob left us, to go seek learning from Kienan."

"Kienan?! How does Bob know Kienan?" Mivoen said, banging the
table in surprise.

"Kienan actually saved us from an attacking army led by Nodnull.
Then he offered to let Bob train with him. At the time Bob said
no, but after Bucky's death... Bob blames himself for not being
strong enough to protect Bucky. And he blames us for putting
him and Bucky in the situation."

"oh no." Mivoen said.

"We came here to ask you what we should do."

"If Bob is with Kienanâ€¦"
