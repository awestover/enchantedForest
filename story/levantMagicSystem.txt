Beginner
	Can channel raw elemental power through diamas
	Line diamas weapon with that element
	- (glowing planatation or rock for earth)
	- (streams of water/lightning for storm)
	- (unfurling shadows wrapped around weapon + icy temperature for shadow)
	- (glowing red-hot blade, encircled in flames for fire)

	- Earth: on contact with dirt patches, speed/strength/healing increase even more than usual
	- Storm: 
	(no need for the other two; Bob will have mastered the basics of levancy by the time they are introduced to the story)

	* manipulates terrain, stone spikes jut out and kills the kirin
	* shards of diamas metal chipped off and stuck in Bob's hand, channels raw levantic power and kills the kirin

Advanced
	Create "physical" weapons out of it; shields, swords, arrows, etc
	Aura of ability shielding levancer from harm, wears down over time
	"flame-wreathed knuckles"
	Use the element as stepping stones to gain leverage doing combat
	Create bindings beforehand, aliases that chain complicated commands together, activated by thought/spellword/hand gesture

	- Earth: terrain manipulation/vine growth, earthquakes, Phytokinesis/summon a plant-based champion
	- Storm: rings of wind stopping people from getting in melee range, tracking eletric orbs that stun and deal damage
	- Shadow: teleportation, necromancy, inducing insanity, shadow-based aura causes chip damage over time
	- Fire: ghostly/hellish black jets of flame, supernova-explosions, detonating firebombs

	* bob gets wings in stormland?


	Idea: 
	Light levancy has blue lightning, red flames, no access to shadow levancy
	Dark levancy has red lightning, purple-black hellfire
