Bob followed Azalea through the tunnels, arriving at a dark grotto. 

“Holy...” Bob was left speechless. The grotto was illuminated by chasms and deposits of glowing minerals, eliminating the need for torchlights. 

“Boss won’t be happy with the peasant you brought back.” A man with winged sandals nodded in greeting, as he sipped from a canteen of Lampyris-knows-what. 

Azalea scowled. “The peasant, as you call him, might be our only chance at salvation. Look at his eyes. ”

The man peered at Bob’s face. “Forest green flecked with silver… “ he murmured in disbelief. “It’s him. The Chosen One.“

“Holdup” Bob raised a hand. “First of all, who” he gestured at the man, “The hell is he, and what is this ‘chosen one’ rubbish?” 

Azalea rolled her eyes. “This is Mercury. He’s our main supplier, in addition to being a full-time annoyance. Give him your shepherd’s crook.”

“The standard build then?” Mercury grimaced, as Bob warily handed him the wooden crook. “Man, this thing is absolutely horrendous. I’m going to make a few minor adjustments. Hope you don’t mind.”

Bob stared in horror as Mercury chopped the curved portion off. “You defaced my crook!” he protested. “It was a family heirloom!”

“The balance and design were simply horrible really, completely impractical in terms of combat. This is so much better”, Mercury explained, as he started applying some sort of adhesive. Then he pulled out some metallic strips and began lining the formerly-crook-now-staff with it. 

Azalea sat down and began cleaning her sword. “As for the Chosen One… you’ll have to wait a bit later before you’re allowed to hear about that.”

Mercury handed the staff back to Bob. “Here,” he said. “It’s lined with diamas metal now. The material serves as… a conduit for levancy, if I may. When ingested, it grants levanters enhanced healing and levantic abilities. You can also redirect or amplify your powers through physical weapons with diamas embedded in them. Alchemists have been debating about the existence of the Philosopher’s Stone for centuries, and it turns out that diamas comes pretty damned close to being the levancer’s equivalent of it.”

Azalea admired the shining gleam of her polished blade. “Mercury capped the ends with diamas as well. It should be able to handle anything you come across for now until you get Vee to fix you something better. She’s the one who forged my sword. Out of diamas as well, obviously.”

“Victoria, or Vee, is our blacksmith.” Mercury clarified. “Now, that’ll be a hundred seg.”

Bob raised an eyebrow. “I thought you were the supplier.”

"Well, if you don't have cash, I also accept payment in the form of blood-bound magical favors or your firstborn child."

“Mercury, stop teasing him”, Azalea chided.

“Also, shopkeeper would be the more adequate term. Azalea gets things for free because I owe her a life debt. It’s a long story. Don’t expect free handouts after this.”

“But fine. He’s going to have to do me a favor though.” Mercury turned towards Bob. “I need the unicorn on the Turquoise Grasslands out of the way. 

“A unicorn.” Bob said, deadpanned. “You expect a 17 year-old llama herder, with no combat experience, to defeat a unicorn.”

“You’ll be fine. The Levant is particularly strong in this area, for reasons I’m not allowed to tell you yet. It’ll guide your movements and improve your reflexes. Just stay calm, don’t do anything stupid, and drink this vial of highly illegal drugs.” Mercury held out a bottle filled with shimmering liquid. 

“This vial of WHAT?”

“...I’m messing with you, this is the concoction of diamas metal and other solvents I mentioned earlier. 

Azalea smiled wryly. “It IS technically illegal under Malimost’s rule, though quite frankly, we don’t really give a damn about what a power-obsessed dragon considers legal or illegal.” 

Some time later…. 

“Alright Bob. I’ll take care of the boars, and you tackle the unicorn. Don’t look at me like that, you’re the one with the uber-cool superhuman abilities.” 

Bob had other doubts. 
“Maybe we should just leave.” 

“C’mon, you have to at least give it a try! What’s the worst that could happen?”

“Do NOT ask THAT QUESTION! Every time, I swear to Lampyris, why do you always have to jinx it? This is like deja vu of that time with the rabid llam-”

“Okay, okay calm down i get it. But the stakes are low, and we could always retreat if things get bad. We’ve both dealt with wild boars before, and with your new abilities, the unicorn should be a joke.”

Bob glared at Buchanan. “You actually have zero concern for your personal safety.”

“Tell me something we didn’t already know.”
