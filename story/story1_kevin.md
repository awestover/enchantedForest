Chapter 2
Bob followed Azalea through the tunnels, arriving at a dark grotto. 
“DEITY...” Bob was left speechless. The grotto was illuminated by chasms and deposits of glowing minerals, eliminating the need for torchlights. 
“Boss won’t be happy with the peasant you brought back”, a man with winged sandals nodded in greeting as he sipped from a canteen of DEITY-knows-what. 
Azalea scowled. “The peasant, as you call him, might be our only hope at salvation. Look at his eyes. ”
	The man peered at Bob’s face. “Forest green flecked with silver… “ he murmured in disbelief. “It’s him. The Chosen One.“
	“Holdup” Bob raised a hand. “First of all, who” he gestured at the man, “The hell is he, and what is this ‘chosen one’ rubbish?” 
	“As you so elegantly inquired,” Azalea rolled her eyes, “This is Mercury. He’s our main supplier, in addition to being a full-time annoyance. Give him your shepherd’s crook.”
	“The standard build then?” Mercury grimaced while Bob warily handed him the wooden crook. “Man this thing is absolutely horrendous. I’m going to make a few minor adjustments. I hope you don’t mind.”
	Bob stared in horror as Mercury chopped the curved portion off. “You defaced my crook!” he protested. “It was a family heirloom!”
	“The balance and design were simply horrible really, completely impractical in terms of combat. This is so much better”, Mercury explained, as he started applying some sort of adhesive. Then he pulled out some metallic strips and began lining the formerly-crook-now-staff with it. 
	Azalea sat down and began cleaning her sword. “The Prophecy states that one day, 


Mercury handed the staff back to Bob. “Here,” he said. “It’s lined with diamas metal now. The material serves as… a conduit for levancy, if I may. When ingested, it grants levanters enhanced healing and levantic abilities. You can also redirect or amplify your powers through physical weapons with diamas embedded in them. Alchemists have been debating about the existence of the Philosopher’s Stone for centuries, and it turns out that diamas comes pretty damned close to being the levancer’s equivalent of it.”
	Azalea admired the shining gleam of her polished blade. “Mercury capped the ends with diamas as well. It should be able to handle anything you come across for now until you get Vee to fix you something better. She’s the one who forged my blade. Out of diamas as well, obviously.”
	“Victoria, or Vee, is our blacksmith.” Mercury clarified. “Now, that’ll be a hundred seg.”
	Bob raised an eyebrow. “I thought you were the supplier.”
	“Mercury, he's a new recruit”, Azalea chided.
	“Fine. He’s going to have to do me a favor though.” Mercury turned towards Bob. “I need the unicorns on the Turquoise grasslands out of the way.”

Cant use the levant, which is why he needs wings, used to be brilliant at fighting, ?dies later on in the story?


	“‘Shopkeeper’ would be the more adequate term. Azalea gets things for free because I owe her a life debt. It’s a long story.”





c'mon give it a try! What's the worst that could happen?
do NOT ASK THAT QUESTION <DEITYNAME> every time, i swear why do you always have to jinx it
