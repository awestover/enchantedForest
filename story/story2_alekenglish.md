# Chapter 4

Bob could hardly believe what had happened to his life. Just a single week
earlier his only concern in life was the well being of his herd of llama's, and
when he would get back to the village to see his family, and his friend Sarah.
Now, a single week later, everyone he had ever known, with the sole exception
of Buchanan, was dead. Boars, some of Malimost's bound servants, had burned the
small village to its foundations, and killed the inhabitants. Although Bob
doubted that the boars did this on orders from Malimost -- Malimost wouldn't
deem his small village important enough to personally notice for whatever
unexplained offense had led to its destruction -- it was still the dragon's
fault.

He still felt numb every time he thought about the destruction of his village.
*How could this happen?* This village was all that he knew! Bob was completely 
shook and at a loss for how to move on with his life. On the one hand he
clearly could not go back to his peaceful, existence as a llama herder; a
blissfully uneventful existence that was not boring for lack of events but
rather pleasant. No Bob could never return to this idyllic way of living. The 
obvious reason for this was that he and Buchanan had been forced to abandon
their llamas in their flight from the minions of Malimost that they found
ravaging the village. Furthermore, it simply wasn't safe. However Bob
desperately wanted to return to this existence. He did not feel, as Buchanan
foolishly seemed to that the destruction of his village meant that they had to
fight against Malimost. What a ludicrous idea! Bob infernally chided his overly
hopeful friend. Bob had about as much chance of decreasing how terrible
Malimost's rule was as he had of winning the annual village swimming contest,
and Bob couldn't swim.

*Eventually*, Bob supposed, *I will have to seek out some other location, and
somehow acquire more animals to shepherd or something*. Maybe I could be a
farmer? However, at the moment Bob was very far from anywhere where he could
do this. And Bob wasn't going to abandon Buchanan, he'd convince him to come to.
Buchanan was sane, he'd listen to reason, Bob hoped. 

This plan relied on Bob and Buchanan not dying in the immediate future however,
and death recently had become a prospect which was drearily high probability.
Memories of Bob's fight against the unicorn haunted him. And yet there was also
a surprising spark of excitement during the battle: when Bob had realized that
he could really naturally channel the Levant. The feel of his magical cane
turned staff in his hand had been reassuring, a firm pillar amidst the chaos of battle.
He would like to experience it again, although of course not in a dangerous situation.

Buchanan walked over. "Hey Bob! You just get up?" Buchanan amicably said,
standing over Bob as Bob, groaning, finally got up at the sound of Buchanan's foot steps.

"It's impossible to tell when it's day and when it's night in these blasted
caverns" Bob complained, "and I'm exhausted from my battles".

"Well you are the chosen one! Better get used to battles and exhaustion and the
like." Buchanan said, in an air much too casual for Bob's liking.

*Oh, not this prophecy nonsense again* Bob internally groaned. Buchanan was
obsessed with this prophecy that he had apparently heard many times when he was
young: that a green eyed llama herder, the first levancer among his people,
would suffer a great tragedy and go on to exact retribution on Malimost.
Or something. In truth the prophecy was incredibly vague, and muddled through
constant retelling via the oral tradition.
Somehow, Buchanan believed that Bob's victory over the unicorn in
addition to the other events that have transpired proved that Bob was some how
special and destined to save people form Malimost's oppressive rule. 

This of course was utter nonsense. His newfound levantic powers were of course very surprising.
However it was very unlikely that Bob would become a strong levancer, and
completely laughable to speak of him opposing Malimost, who was a more powerful
levancer than even the legendary Rand!
No one better than Malimost had challenged him in a thousand years, not that
Malimost gave levanters much chance: Malimost made sure that levanters were
bound to him as early as possible, or killed if they would not consent to be bound with his oath stone.
There were always rogue levanters who were able to hide, but these were insignificant flies compared to Malimost.

No, Bob was not destined for great power. 
Usually when Levancy first started showing up in the children in a new region the levanters were incredibly weak.
No one really knew how new aspects of the Levant were created. The Levant was
clearly tied in an intricate way to the geography of a region: the strength of each type of
Levancy that levanters could channel depended greatly on where they were. Only the most powerful levanters could 
even channel levancy of a different type than the source that occupied their region. 
When a source of Levant came to a new region some children -- it wasn't clear
how they was determined, although some hypothesized that the children had to
have been somehow "exposed" directly to the new source of Levancy -- would develop Levantic abilities. 

Maybe in some time long gone Bob's powers might have been a blessing that gave
him great joy. Now however 
they were a mark over his head. It would be exceedingly difficult to find a way
to live the quiet life that he desired, as if any of Malimost's minions found
out about him he would be hunted down.

Now that Bob had defeated the unicorn Mercury and Azeala had promised that they would help him and Buchanan.
It was time to go see what plan they had in mind.

"Let's go talk to Azeala and Mercury now that we've killed their dang unicorns."
Bob said, pointedly ignoring Buchanan's comment about his supposed destiny.

"You're not even going to wait for breakfast?" Buchanan laughed.

"No, I want to get this over with as soon as possible", Bob said seriously "we
can eat once we're on the road to safety, and once they've explained why we had
to risk our necks to kill those unicorns."

"Bob, you know that those unicorns were probably somewhat responsible for the
desolation of our village..." Buchanan, said, sounding surprised at Bob's
anger.

"I don't freaking care!" Bob screamed. "The majority of the world is an
accomplice of Malimost! Any other minion could have destroyed the village for a
reason as arbitrary as whatever the unicorns had. The destroyed village is a
sunk cost. There's no fixing it. Nothing we can do will bring them back. It'll
just make us join them in the ranks of the dead. And don't you start about that
corroded prophecy and hope for a better life for the rest of the inhabitants
of this earth and about how I'm being selfish. I'm simply sensible and you know
it!"

Buchanan looked somewhat put out by this. But it of course wasn't in his
nature to verbally argue with Bob about this. Nor was it his nature to be
swayed from his foolish beliefs in prophecies. Most of the time Bob 
thought that these traits were fairly admirable in Buchanan. But 
an optimist only survived when times were good. In bad times optimism was often
fatal.

Bob quickly rolled up his gear into his pack and he and Buchanan walked down
the cavern paths in silence: Bob in angry silence, Buchanan in contemplative
silence.

They reached the glowing central cavern and Bob was again shocked by its
magnificence. In contrast to the rest of the caverns this cavern was intensely
brightly lit, by torches covering the walls and large fire pits with roaring
bonfires. The seeming waste of this light would have bothered him if he didn't
know that this wood did not release flames that burned hot, the flames emitted
electromagnetic radiation in a remarkably specific subset of the visible
spectrum: namely the emitted almost solely visible light. Furthermore the wood
had remarkably high energy density. The combined effect was that this wood
could glow a vibrant bright white for a very long time. The flames served a
dual purpose: to provide light, and to provide a reminder that the people in
this cavern resisted Malimost, and had powerful levanters, for example a master
of plant levancy who was willing to set up this light supply for them.

Stalagmites glistened above, the light reflecting off of their many surfaces.
On close inspection this room was similarly wet to the other caverns, but this
place felt much less dreary because of the light.

Buchanan spotted Mercury and Azeala waiting at the booth where they had
advertised that they would be waiting. They looked incredibly anxious, and
clearly had not yet spotted Bob and Buchanan.

Right as he was about to start walking towards them however, he had a very rational thought. 
"Wait Bucky" he whispered, "can we talk about this first?"

"What? Is something wrong Bob?" Buchanan said, showing his characteristic look of concern.

"It's just, well, we didn't really understand how dangerous it was going to be
to face that unicorn. Honestly we could have died."

"Well, yeah" Buchanan admitted reluctantly. "But doesn't it feel good to
defeat them? We made the world a safer place..." Buchanan trailed off when he
saw Bob's expression of disgust. "OK, but that was a one time thing, and I'm
sure this unicorn horn is of vital importance to them", he said gesturing to
his pack which contained their hard won unicorn horn. "They'll help us now".
"We can go somewhere safe, and you will have time to learn about your new
Levantic abilities. Then when you're ready the prophecy implies that you will
be presented some opportunity to overthrow Malimost and make the world a better
place!" Buchanan said enthusiastically.

"Important opportunities never present themselves, they only come after intense
personal effort", Bob derisively said, although the affect was diminished by it
being said in a whisper. 

"Listen Buchanan though, this prophecy business is exactly what I'm worried
about. They, like you, seem to believe I probably have an important part in
their so-called battle against Malimost. Even if they aren't deluded by this
prophecy they know that I'm a Levancer. I don't think they are going to let me
go off into some quiet place. I think they're going to push me to go on a quest
to defeat Malimost."

Buchanan sighed. "I doubt it. But if it's true I'll stand by you: you
shouldn't be forced to go on a quest before you're ready."

"No one is ever ready for something that they cannot do yet" Bob thought. But
he decided not to point this out verbally. "Thanks Bucky! I knew I could count on you." he said instead.

Bob and Buchanan walked across the large cavern to the booth where Mercury and Azeala were waiting.
Their faces lit up in what Bob thought looked suspiciously like surprise at seeing him and Buchanan alive.

"Did you get me the unicorn horn I needed" Mercury asked, sounding pleased.

"Yes I've got it right here!" Buchanan said happily, moving to pull it out.

"Not right here..." Azeala said. "Let's have this conversation somewhere a bit
more private. I think that a lot of things about this shouldn't become common
knowledge. These people are good people but the only true way to contain a secret
is to never spread it in the first place."

Rather than placate Bob as Azeala might have guessed this would, the attempts
at greater secrecy worried Bob. It reeked of further plotting to Bob, and he
did not like the sound of that. Furthermore the idea that secrets were not sage
even in this stronghold was greatly disturbing, not in the least because Bob
had kind of naively taken for granted that he was not being spied on. Bob wasn't
very used to this whole being rogue thing.

Bob reluctantly followed after Azeala, Mercury and Buchanan into a tunnel
stemming off from the main cavern. After walking for a very short while
they came to a small enclosed room. They walked in and Mercury bolted closed the door.
"We are totally secure now" said Azeala. "This room has been Levantically
soundproofed, no-one, even with levancy could possibly hear our discussion now".

Bob snorted derisively. He sincerely doubted that the security placed on this
room was truly unbreakable to a levantic measure.

"Don't believe me, do you?" Azeala smirked at his chagrined expression when he
realized that she had heard him. The existence of one-way functions with
back doors is not so implausible, it is in fact the basis for this really cool
algorithm in theoretical computer science called RSA.

"Yeah", Mercury chimed in, "or for an even simpler example just think about the
problem of factoring a semi-prime in the cases where you have no information and
the case where you are given a prime divisor of the semi-prime!"

"Um, OK" Bob said. "It just seems hard to do that with like sound waves."
Like sure you could encrypt a digital signal, but we have an analog time series here.

"just because you cannot understand it right now doesn't mean that it's false."
Azeala reprimanded. "If you were thinking less skeptically you would realize
that you actually understand very little about Levancy so it is entirely
plausible that you would not the mechanism by which it works"

"Although truth be told neither of us have any idea how it works either" Mercury admitted after a pause.

"OK, to business. You can get out the unicorn horn now Buchanan" Azeala said in a business manner.

Buchanan pulled out the unicorn horn and handed it to Azeala.

"It's really true." Azeala whispered in wonder, clearly speaking only to
herself. "The prophecy, everything that we believed in".

"Enough!" Bob shouted. "You can find another poor fellow to trick into
fulfilling your dang prophecy. I won't be fooled though. The whole endeavor is hopeless".

Heedless of Bob, Azeala chanted

> "The chosen one shall come forth from the llama lands, and have eyes as green as the grass that the llama is grazed on
> a humble llama shepherd by birth, and yet destined to shake the earth
> the one will be known by their green eyes and the fact that if they beat a unicorn in battle and take its horn then the horn will turn black
> the one will face great tribulations e.g. getting their village burned down, and will take a path either to eradicate evil or become it"

Bob was shook by the power of her voice, but shook it off, there was no such
thing as prophecy. Azeala had just practiced theatrical skills. It was easy to
impress a poor llama herder. Before Bob could object further Mercury pulled
another horn, this one a pure white. Not the beautiful pearly white of a
typical unicorn horn, but rather a blinding white light that almost hurt to
look at, in the same way that the unicorn horn that Bob had collected from the
unicorn had turned darker than the darkest night.

"This is the fabled horn created by the legendary levancer Rand shortly before
his death. If you'll remember Rand was actually the oracle that initially issued the 
very prophecy that you are destined to fulfil. Rand had no idea why he was
making this horn at the time that he made it, but made it because of an
impression that it would be important in the future."

"And lucky that he did, he died shortly after making it. It has long been
conjectured that this horn had some relation to the prophecy, it is too much of
a coincidence that a black horn appears in the prophecy, an obvious dual to the
white horn supposedly created by Rand. 
I say supposedly because the horn was lost after Rand died, many people assumed
that it burned with the rest of Rand's famed tower of Levancy and the artifacts
that Malimost burned there.
If not, it seemed almost certain that the horn had come into possession of
Malimost, he collected nearly all the magical artifacts."

"However, we found this horn lying on the ground somewhere recently. 
And then we ran into you.
We had to know if the prophecy was true.
We know it was super dangerous to send you, a barely awakened levancer, to face a unicorn.
But we had to. Had to know.
And now? It appears that we were correct."

"Most people seem to believe that when the chosen one wields both horns and
shouts copolla then something magical will happen, which will be critical
towards bringing about the downfall of Malimost."

"So how about you try it?"

Bob was totally blow away. "No way" he tried to object, but it sounded
half-hearted even to himself.

"You've got nothing to lose if this is all a prophecy dreamed up by a 
17 year old at 2:13 AM with a messed up sleep schedule." Azeala noted rationally.

"OK, I'll do it" Bob whispered.

Azeala and Mercury reverently bestowed the horns to Bob, the deep black horn to
the left hand and the pure white horn to the right hand.

Bob held them apprehensively. Then, after looking to Buchanan who vigorously
affirmed that he thought this was a great idea with a nod of his head, Bob
touched the horns together and whispered "Coppolla".

At first it seemed like nothing was going to happen.
However, after a few seconds, fireflies swarmed out of unseen pores in the caverns. 
The fireflies congregated into a massive blob in front of Bob.

"Fireflies are particularly connected to the Levant" Azeala noted quietly. "This is super cool".

"Hello friend!" The sound emanated from the mass of fireflies. 
"I have no idea what a situation you are in, but I
know that it will surely be very dire, hence I was instructed to make these
precautions. It seems that if must record this something bad is going to happen to me.
However the time frame for this is not clear, so I fear not for myself. I
believe that I will likely die a peaceful death one day, when I am ready. More, I
fear for you and your fellow citizens in whatever trying time that you live. 
Because of how hard your time will likely be, I have made this provision to help you."

"I have keyed this recording to your hand: in order to be seeing this recording
you must fit the description giving in the prophecy. The white unicorn horn is
keyed to your humble upbringing as a llama herder, while the black unicorn
horn is keyed to your great potential levantic power.
United together the white horn that I created, and the black horn that you must
have created by defeating a unicorn with your levantic powers, will, by the
levancy that I have worked on my white horn, create this recording for you."

"You might wonder how I am protecting this information from getting into the
wrong hands, for a powerful malicious levancer could equally well defeat a
unicorn."

"The protection is in the white unicorn horn. I won't get into any details, but
it would basically incinerate you if you were seeking the secret that I have hidden 
out of desire for personal power or gain."

"Bob, as the chosen one, you are marked. You are blessed with incredibly strong
levantic abilities, but also cursed with the fact that a sufficiently powerful
dark levancer with the right artifacts can easily detect you. You lived a
peaceful existence before your fate became clear. However, now it is evident
that there is only one way forward for you: you must rid the world of whatever
great evil has come upon it."

"My general advice for how to go about this would be to train with Levancy
until you are sufficiently good to defeat whatever adversary it is that you
face."

"If you believe that will be sufficient, that is certainly the safest way"

"However, I feel that it is likely that you are new and unexperienced compared
to your foe. Thus, I will tell you something that I sincerely hope no one else
knows. The secret I am about to tell you is very dangerous. You must make sure it
does not get into the wrong hands. I have trust in you however."

"Once, when I was a much younger levancer, less acquainted with the art of
levancy, I discovered an extremely powerful artifact. It is called
*Amplification*. Amplification has the ability to modify levantic strength, in
particular by multiplying it by a scalar in (0,2) of the wielders choice in a
bubble around the wielder. I heard lore of this artifact, went searching for it
and eventually found it. The power of this artifact is unlike any other
artifact that I know of. It has the ability to increase ones levantic power
such as to be sufficient to crush any with even vaguely similar levels of
levantic power beforehand. It could be used to mask levantic presence while
sneaking. It could be used to mitigate the levantic powers of a powerful
levancer. A levancer holding this artifact would have an unbeatable edge in any
battle!"

"In my naivety I took it. I used it. It felt amazing. But I realized that I was
growing addicted to it so I stopped."

"I tell you this story to make sure that you do not treat the sword of
amplification lightly as I did. However, don't worry overmuch, if you 
only use it once or twice you should be fine."

"To secure the sword of amplification I used it to seal it with the levancy.
Only if you get 3 enchantments to say, which I will denote as the keys, can you
pull the sword of amplification from the fabric of the levant. These keys will
not be easy to obtain, but there can be no security with shortcuts: by
achieving the keys you will have proved yourself. "

"The first key is guarded by Lincoln the Leviathan, in the depths of the sea of
storms. Once you acquire that key I will give you the information about how to
get the rest of the keys."

"Best of luck to you! And hurry! Presumably the fate of the world rests on your
shoulders. If that's not enough, also the weight of the future. At the very
least your own fate is in jeopardy. Cyaaaaaaaa."

After the cloud of fireflies echoed the last word of Rand's message the cloud
dispersed into individual fireflies that in turn receded into the pores of the cavern.

Azeala wasted no time, "Bob, do you understand how important this is now? Will
you seek the sword of amplification? And will you use it to defeat Malimost?"

Bob thought about protesting on the grounds that they didn't know that Rand had
spoken truly in the message, or even that the message was from the legendary
levancer Rand, or even that such a person ever existed. He decided not to however.
He tried to make a habit of not lying to himself. Instead he stalled effectively.

"Yes I understand how important this is. Sorry this is such a huge shock.
Please give me a moment to think about the implications of this statement" Bob
said in a weak voice. Bob wasn't opposed to lying to others, yet the weak voice
was not completely a lie intended to garner pity and give him some time. The words
of Rand were genuinely very disturbing. *I'm marked?* Bob thought. *Malimost
will never leave me alone as long as he can detect my levancy?* *Should I go on this quest?*
*Am I seriously considering this? It's ridiculously dangerous.* *And yet at the
same time, probably much safer than waiting for Malimost to come and destroy
me. I guess I have to either learn how to use levancy well enough to protect
myself, or figure out how to hide myself.* Bob suddenly remembered that Bob had
said that the sword of Amplification not only possessed the ability to Amplify
power, but also to dampen it, hiding the wielding levancer. 

"I will pursue this quest." Bob finally said, just as people were getting
uncomfortable with his silence. "I will travel to the sea of storms, claim the
first key from the Leviathan. Then I will keep travelling to find the rest of
the keys, and acquire the sword of Amplification. And finally, once I have acquired this
unmatched artifact, I will use it to free myself from the continual pursuit of Malimost."

Azeala and Mercury were taken aback from his sudden seeming willingness to
embark on a quest to defeat Malimost.

"I knew you'd decide to do the right thing!" Bucky praised, "The world will
forever remember you as the one who freed the world from Malimost's tyranny. If
you will accept me as your companion on the quest I will gladly accompany you!"

Real tears filled Bob's eyes. By design of Bob's cryptic commit message Bucky
completely misunderstood him. Yes Bob would pursue the Sword of Amplification.
But he would not use the artifact to confront Malimost. He would use it to mask
his levantic scent, freeing him from the pursuit of Malimost. He, and Bucky too
of course, could find some new pasture, a new flock of llamas to tend. Bob was
not so presumptuous as to adopt the world as his flock to protect. Bucky would
understand one day. The keys were likely not very heavily guarded. In essence
he had to fight three more "bosses" similar in power to the unicorn that he had
fought the previous day. With the aid of powerful rogue levanters, that Mercury
and Azeala were certain to make help them now that his position as "the chosen
one" was confirmed, these battles should be fairly straightforward. In the
process of his travels he would also be able to learn levancy from some masters.
This would probably prove useful in his future. Bob estimated that he had maybe
a 90% shot at getting each key, and that the events "Bob gets key i" for
i=1,2,3 were likely independent. Thus he had approximately a 72% chance of
success overall. This was compared to the alternative of facing Malimost, a
more powerful levancer than any alive in 1000 years, more powerful than this
Rand fellow who was giving him this quest. Bob estimated his chance of success
against Malimost to be about 0.01%. Of course this had to be weighted by the
fact that it was a more desirable outcome: Bob wouldn't have to hide all his
life. However, his objective function was clearly maximized by the first
strategy. Of course Bob's tear filled eyes would be misinterpreted as gratitude. 
Bob almost couldn't stand it.

"Of course I want you to come Bucky!" Bob gladly cried. "What of the people who
resist Malimost? Am I correct in assuming that we now get an army of levanters to 
help us in this crucial quest? "

"Well" Azeala said looking ashamed, glancing at Mercury who also looked
ashamed, "not exactly". "You see, not everyone here can be trusted. There are
some who don't believe so strongly in the prophecy. There are many who would
see you as a weak levancer, and believe that they deserve this powerful
artifact more than you. For honorable reasons, or even selfish reasons. No,
it's essential that you do not tell anyone that we don't trust."

"How do we know we can trust you?" Bob said angrily. He was very scared, and thus lashed out.

"Bob" Bucky said, mortified at Bob's disrespect, "without Azeala and Mercury,
we would be dead. They saved us from the boars at our village. At great
personal risk! If there is anyone we can trust it is Azeala and Mercury."

*Why do you assume as an axiom that there exists someone we can trust?* Bob's
incessant internal cynic bitterly said. But Bob was mostly able to suppress
this poisonous voice. He knew that Bucky was right, and he didn't doubt Azeala's word.
Nonetheless this was highly troubling.

"OK, I understand, Bob" said reluctantly.

"Awesome. Me and Mercury will of course accompany you" Azeala said, without
bothering to ask if Bob would appreciate their company. "We should leave soon
for the storm land. There is actually a teleporter nearby here, and a linked
teleporter in the storm land. How about we leave tomorrow? Me and Mercury can
make final preparations for our journeys today."

"OK" Bob said simply.

They discussed some logistics, and then returned to the main cavern.

"We'll meet at the teleporter tomorrow morning, crack of dawn", Azeala declared.

"Think you can manage that Bob?", Bucky joked; Bob was not an expert at getting
up early, a fact that Bucky was fond of joking about.

"You can just explore the caverns today" Azeala said.

Then she and Mercury left them. Bucky dragged Bob all around the caverns. Bob
wasn't too excited about it, but they were really very remarkable, and
beautiful. They talked and joked about trivial matters. Bob could almost forget
about how much his life had been drastically altered in the past week. 

And then they heard screams, from far away, in the direction of the main cavern.
Bob and Bucky looked at each other, and nodded, they were in sync. They both
knew that they both knew that this was likely minions of Malimost coming after 
Bob because of this curse that was on him as "the chosen one". Whispering felt
appropriate in the situation.

"We have to get away from llama land. We should take the teleporter to storm
land" Bucky whispered.

"They're probably going to be heading towards the teleporter to stop us from
escaping..." Bob noted.

"They might not know where it is." Bucky noted.

Bob took inventory. He had a vial of diamas that Mercury had given him, in
addition to his enhanced shepherds crook. In his brief fight against the boar
next to his village, and his fight with the kirin he had been able to
instinctively wield the levant. In the worst case scenario 
Bucky had some weapons too, Bob didn't quite remember what, but he had held his
own against the boars in the fight with the Kirin.

Bob considered their options. They could stay trapped in this side tunnel,
where Malimost's minions would inevitably sniff them out eventually, or they
could head towards the source of the screaming -- hoping to avoid notice in what
was likely to become a large battle, or possibly a large massacre-- and sneak
by to the teleporter. In-action was the decision to be hunted down. Acting,
though risky, at least gave them a chance.

"OK Bucky, I guess you're right", Bob decided. "Let's head towards the main
cavern. Maybe in the confusion we can get past to the teleporter."

"Are you sure? It seems pretty dangerous" Bucky said, his worry for Bob now
overriding his rationality. 

"Yes, I think it's the safest way. If we stay here we're bound to be found."

The matter decided, they took off running for the main cavern. As they
approached the sounds of what was clearly a battle -- for the moment at least
-- became louder. When they came to the mouth of the tunnel they stopped to
assess the situation. It was chaos. The same boars that had attacked their
village had found the caverns and were waging war on the caverns. As Bob
watched the people of the cavern boldly fought against the boars, striking many down.
However, many of the people were already bleeding from wounds where they had
been gored by the razor sharp tusks of the boars.

Bob saw the tunnel that led to the teleporter which Azeala had pointed out
previously. There was no way that they could get to it. The hoard of boars was 
positioned exactly so as to block anyone from escaping by that route.
Bob was about to tell Bucky that they had better turn back and try to hide
somewhere in the vast network of tunnels. Maybe the people would kill enough
boars that they would have insufficient troops to conduct a thorough search.
Maybe they could find another escape route. Being here was clearly futile, and
dangerous.

But before Bob could say this a voice rang out loudly in the cavern.

"Fall back!" a loud voice said, clearly directed at the people.

Bob watched as all the people fled into tunnels, and the boars, momentarily
confused at the sudden disengagement did not pursue them.

The woman who had spoken was the only person left in the large main cavern.
Although she was facing the boars all alone, she did not look scarred, only
resolute. 

She held out a thin sword, lined with diamas, and it suddenly burst into
flames. She pointed it at a section of the horde of boars and an enormous
fireball emanated from her sword, its heading aligned with the orientation of
her sword. The concentrated beam of flame completely disintegrated the boars
that it hit. The rest of the boars were shaken from their brief moment of
shock -- it had taken very little time for the Fire Levancer to shoot her
fireball -- and charged her. The cavern was immersed in flames as she fought
them off. Looking on, as Bob knew every other person in the caverns was, he
noticed that the fire levancer was glowing -- not the orangeish-red glow of a
fire but a soft white glow. 

As he watched she sliced through countless boars with her glowing blade, which
seemed to easily pass through their bodies, and completely disintegrate them.

It was a stunning display of power. However, Bob also noticed that the battle
was not one-sided. The occasional boar would get a hit in on her. She was
bleeding from several cuts on her arms and legs. However, she kept going until
the last boar was disintegrated. Everything was still for a moment. The woman
turned around, and although there was no way she could know where he was, she
seemed to look straight at him, as if she knew him.

"More will come." She whispered, her voice amplified by the emptiness of the
cavern. "Go. Now."

Then she fell over, dead from loss of blood.
The people emerged from the tunnels and headed towards the teleporter. No
one talked, although many quietly sobbed. 

Everyone decided to leave the caverns, the fire levancer was right, they were
not safe anymore.

Bob and Bucky got in the fast moving line of people walking up to the
teleporter to storm land. When it was their turn they ran up to the huge
platform and stepped through the shimmering teleporter.

They emerged into storm land, and waited for Mercury and Azeala, who they hoped
would soon emerge from the teleporter to give them guidance. Eventually they
did, looking slightly beat up from the attack of the boars, but not seriously
injured. 

"Follow me" Azeala said quietly, and she led them to a shelter where they spent
the night.

# Chapter 5

Bob woke to Bucky shaking him awake. The morning was dreary, and everyone's
mood was subdued, which still seemed appropriate after the shocking sacrifice
of the fire Levancer -- whose name Bob didn't even know -- during their escape
last night. 

"Eat this" Bucky quietly said, handing him some instant blueberry oatmeal that
had been prepared by pouring cold water on oats and blueberries. It tasted awful, 
but Bob didn't complain.

"Get ready, we have to leave soon" Azeala said.

*Why? Bob skeptically thought, annoyed. It's so early. And there's no danger
here, we've teleported far away from danger, and the teleporter will have been sealed off.*
*No we aren't safe, Bob's cynic argued, turning against itself. You will never be safe again until you have the Sword of Amplification.*

Aloud Bob said "Azeala. I'm not ready."

"Oh Bob. Always gotta get your 10 hours of sleep don't yah!" Bucky joked.

Azeala however understood his plea.

"Yes. Me and Mercury talked about this. You fared quite handily against the
Kirin, but that was probably somewhat due to luck. Facing the leviathan right
now is probably not the best idea: it would be better if you had some more
training."

"Why can't we just enlist the help of some rogue Levanters?" Bucky asked.

Bob had assumed yesterday that enlisting help would be the plan. After the
battle last night however, he knew that this would not be the case. The
levanters that had fought in the battle at the caves were not very strong. Even
the nameless Fire Levancer who sacrificed herself for all of them was only
moderately powerful. Bob was somewhat surprised that he was able to intuit
this. But when the levanters had channeled the levant he had been able to sense
it and he could tell that his own power was much, much stronger. Furthermore
the rogue levanters would all be scattered after the attack. Bob didn't see how
Azeala would be able to find any of them, let alone convince them to do
something so dangerous.

"For one, they're all scattered" Azeala explained. "But even more than that,
those levancers honestly would probably never have been enough to be a real
help to Bob. He's a lot more powerful than them."

"I have raw power. That's different than being to use it!" Bob protested. "The
leviathan would slaughter me."

"And that's why you're going to learn how to use the Levant properly first. You
will be trained by the best rogue levancer alive!" Azeala said excitedly.
"We'll leave as soon as Mercury gets back. He's just out finding directions
that we will need."

"Why would this levancer be willing to train me?" Bob said skeptically.

"Mivoen LightningBreath has very strong hatred for Malimost." Azeala said.

"Mivoen LightningBreath has very strong hatred for everything else too though."
Mercury said sarcastically strolling in the door to the small room in a cave
where they had spent the night.

"Well, that's true to an extent" Azeala grimaced. "He's had a tough life. He
tried to do the right things, and well, there were negative consequences. But
don't get the wrong impression. He might seem bitter and unfriendly. But he's a
great person."

Mercury laughed, "that's one way of seeing it."

*Awesome* Bob internally groaned. *If they feel like they have to warn me about him then he's probably actually 10 times worse.*

"Well I found our directions!" Mercury said. "The journey should take us about
5 months if we hurry. First we have to take a detour to the fire land and pass
through some active volcano plains to get to a teleporter there that leads into
plant land, from where we will need to sneak into the lair of a dino that
guards another teleporter that leads to the peak of the highest mountain in
storm land. And from there it's a short hike to Mivoen's house! Of course, it's
through the middle of a storm raging in the clouds at the top of the mountain,
but that part of the journey will be exciting. I'd worry about the dino if I
were you. They are supposed to be able to do some pretty intense plant levancy,
like magnitude 8 on the Richter scale earthquakes."

He kept a straight face for all of 2 seconds after finishing his impressive
monologue which Bob guessed -- from the quality of it's performance -- he had
thought of while walking.

His laugh was one of the strangest laughs that Bob had ever heard. Mercury
laughed in according to an irregular rhythm that consisted of him inhaling and
then gasping out breaths in mirth. Bob could only tell that it was laughter
rather Mercury choking by context. 

Somehow, despite the solemn mood that had set over the group after the attack
and escape, and the realization of the enormity of the task in front of them,
the laugh was contagious. First Azeala laughed at Bucky's confused face.
Bucky, who then caught on, did not take offense at having been tricked, but
enjoyed Mercury's joke. Bob couldn't help but join then, Bucky's high pitched
laugh always made him laugh. 

"OK, fine, it's a little less intense than that" Mercury finally admitted once
their laughing session had abated. "There's a path to his house -- which really
is pretty high up in the mountains -- a short ways off. If I remember correctly
it should take a day or two to hike up there. It's probably going to rain
today, but honestly its warm enough that I'd welcome a little showers to cool
us off."

They set off a little while later. On their hike they didn't talk much. Bob
couldn't quite fall into his normal rhythm with Bucky because he felt slightly
uncomfortable around the newcomers. However as a Llama herder he was quite
accustomed to silence, and was fine that it was permeated very infrequently by
comments.

When they stopped for lunch -- a disgusting abundance of tasteless white
albacore tuna on plain wraps. Mercury seemed to regain his characteristic
attitude: chipper and sarcastic. On the hike Bob remembered he had looked
pained, although he tried to hide it. *Does he have some respiratory or
cardiovascular problem?* Bob wondered.

"OK, I have a riddle for you all to try." Mercury said, not bothering to finish
his awful tuna sandwich first. 

"You have a standard deck of cards with 13 cards face up, and the rest face
down, in a pile. You are blindfolded. You want to flip over some cards, and
then split the cards into two piles such that each pile has the same number of
face up cards. How can you do this without looking at the cards?"

"Can you just feel the texture of the cards to determine whether or not they
are face up?" Bob asked. 

"No, the sides feel indistinguishable" Mercury explained.

He left the question in the air for a while and returned to his lunch. 
Bucky was clearly wrestling with the question: he had his eyes closed and was
muttering under his breath, while occasionally pantomiming flipping cards over
in the air. 

*Come on Bucky, eat your lunch.* Bob thought. *Bucky was always too trusting,
too easily excited. The problem was clearly impossible: there was no way you
could determine which cards were face up and which were not!*

"What do you think Bob?" Mercury asked after finishing up his tuna wrap.

"It can't be done" Bob said derisively. "Given any particular card you have no
way of knowing its state."

"What do you think Bucky?" Mercury asked.

"Well, Bob's right that you can't determine the state of any particular card,
by definition of the problem." Bucky said hesitantly. "But you don't need to
know the individual cards states I think". "Let's say we just divide the deck
up into a pile with 13 cards in it, and another pile with the other 39 cards in
it. Well, then the number of face up cards in the small stack plus the number
of face down cards in the small stack has to add to 13, because there are 13
cards total in the small stack. And the number of face up cards in the small
stack plus the number of face up cards in the large stack has to sum to 13
because there are 13 total face up cards. Well, that means that the number of
face down cards in the small stack is the same as the number of face up cards
in the large stack. So if we flip one of the stacks, there will be the same
number of face up cards in each stack!"

"Beautifully said!" Mercury exclaimed.

Bob was shaken. How could you do so much with so little power to observe the
cards?

"I'm sorry," Bob said. "I was wrong".

"It took me a while to think about it right. Don't worry about it Bob." Bucky
said charitably.

Bob was slightly troubled by the matter, but let it drop, and they descended
back into silence as they kept hiking.

They camped at night, although with no fire, and it wasn't a very exciting
time. They were all exhausted, and went quickly to sleep.

As always, Bob woke to Bucky's insistent efforts. 

"Bob" Bucky called in a sing-song voice, "rise and shine".

More well rested, and the events from the cavern a little farther from people's
minds, they started to have small conversation as they continued their hike.
Bob and Bucky shared a little bit about llama herding, and Azeala talked a bit
about her life, although Mercury did not participate much in the conversation:
he looked constantly winded, and Bob felt kind of bad, but did not suggest
slowing: he wanted to get to Mivoen soon.

Azeala told Bob and Bucky about her life as a rogue levancer, and about many
intense things.

Eventually they came to a basin in the side of the mountain and Mercury pointed
out Mivoen's cabin: an innocent looking small wooden structure in the center of
the basin.

As they made the final approach down the basin, a stooped over old man leaning
heavily on a large wooden staff stepped out of the cabin. Bob noticed that one
of his legs, underneath his robes, was missing, replaced by a wooden prosthetic
leg.

"Mivoen! Old friend!" Mercury shouted down to him.

"Who are you! Who dares disturb my abode?" Mivoen shouted, his voice booming
throughout the basin.

"He doesn't seem to recognize you" Bob noted.

"OK, technically I've never met him before" Mercury admitted quietly, "but I've
heard lots of stories about him. I feel like I almost know him. And all
resisters of Malimost are friends, are we not?"

"We are friends Mivoen. I am Azeala. And this is Bob. Bob is has strong
levantic potential, and needs a teacher". Azeala didn't quite have to shout
because by this point they were pretty close to Mivoen.

"Azeala." Mivoen said. He didn't quite sound happy, but his voice at least
sounded less dangerous.

"I guess I won't harm you for coming here. Although you shouldn't have come." Mivoen said.

"Mivoen, Bob needs help learning how to use the Levant. He is the chosen one.
He is on a quest to retrieve an incredibly powerful artifact that Rand set
apart to be found by the chosen one. And once he finds it he will destroy
Malimost with it."

"No." Mivoen spat. "I swore never to become involved in this fight again."

"Mivoen. You live in seclusion, hiding your whole life because of Malimost.
Malimost has taken so much from you: your leg, your dogs. Your joy. You are
already fighting him simply by refusing to swear on his oath stone. You are
simply losing the fight horribly."

"No." Mivoen said, determinedly. "If he truly is the chosen one, he will manage
just fine without me. If not, my training him would only set him up for a death
that he is too arrogant to expect."

"Don't be stupid Mivoen, " Azeala said, growing angry, "you're a hero. You
slayed Malimost's chief boar! You stood against hundreds of unicorns to protect
your dogs. You--"

"I failed!" Mivoen shouted. "I won't have that on my head again."

"You are equally morally accountable for your inaction as you are for your
action. By choosing to not help Bob, you are responsible for whatever ill comes
to him from not having had your training."

"You can travelers can stay in my cabin tonight." Mivoen said, ignoring
Azeala's arguments. "But you must leave in the morning. I'm sorry. I cannot
help you."

And with that he walked off to perform some errand in the woods on the
mountain.

The travelers decided to go into the cabin once he left. 

"Well, from what I've heard, that went much better than we should've expected."
Mercury commented. How do you know Mivoen, Azeala?"

"Before he lost his leg, before he became so bitter and apathetic, Mivoen
freely offered training to any rogue levancer. As you know, I'm pretty weak,
but nonetheless, what little skill I have is due mostly to Mivoen's training.
Azeala reminisced. "I stayed with him as a student for a few months. I think he
naturally becomes attached to all of his students. I doubt this much has
changed about him."

"Don't worry Bob," Azeala told him. "He will teach you."

*I'm not sure you're exactly in the best place to make that judgement*, he
thought skeptically, *you seem to be fixed upon an idealistic version of this
man, one that no longer exists.*

The little cottage was very cramped, so they soon decided to drop their
belongings and go relax outside until Mivoen returned.

"Azeala, Can you teach me a little bit of levancy?" Bob asked after a while. 

"Well sure. How about a little bit of fire levancy? That has always been my
speciality." Azeala responded, somewhat surprised at his sudden eagerness to
learn.

"Try to block out your surroundings. It might even help to close your eyes at
first. Hold out your hand, and imagine a little flame sparking above your hand." Azeala instructed.

Bob did as she instructed. It wasn't hard to believe that a flame would spark,
or even see it sparking with his eyes closed, after the spectacular last stand
of the unnamed Fire Levancer in the caverns. He pictured the flame, and ...
nothing happened. 

"It's not working, " he said, frustratedly, after a few moments. 

"Don't worry. It takes quite a while to be able to consciously control the
Levant." Azeala comforted, not surprised. 

Not placated, Bob tried again. He fiercely imagined a flame coming up from his
hand. Not a gentle flame anymore, a raging fire ball that would illuminate the
entire basin from the grey of dusk to the brighter than at noon.
His focus was entirely singular upon this goal. 
And suddenly he felt it. The blistering heat of a raging fire in his out held hands.

Everyone screamed and retreated from the monstrous flame. 
Bob felt nauseous, similar to the time when he had channeled lightning against
the boars, but much more intensely. 
He looked on in horror as the massive ball of fire that he had created dropped
to the ground, and began spreading like, well, a wild fire, because it was a wild fire.

It would destroy all the wildlife in the basin, and likely spread and burn down
a large section of the forest too. 

Bob tried to imagine a sudden down pouring of rain to put out the fire, but
could not focus because of his nausea.

Suddenly Mivoen emerged from the woods, glowing brighter than Bob's massive
fire. He held out his hands, and a torrent of water poured down onto the
flames, suffocating them.

"I will train you, until you have enough skill so as not to be likely to
accidentally kill yourself and everyone you love." Mivoen said quietly, his
voice transmitted to Bob levantically.

Bob then passed out from exhaustion. 

When he awoke in the morning they discussed the plans. Mivoen would train Bob
in levancy. Azeala and Mercury would train Bob and Bucky how to use weapons and
other important items. Azeala and Mercury would leave at certain times to go
and acquire some items. 

They settled into the routine. Mivoen commanded Bob to start with small acts of
channeling, like summoning little balls of water, and making the grass grow. 

Bob was initially frustrated. "Why do you make me do these useless tasks? I
need to learn how to use the levant to defeat the leviathan!" Bob had asked.

"Think. You know why control is more important than raw power." Mivoen had
responded simply.

As weeks bled past Bob gained proficiency at controlling the Levant. Mivoen
had been right, once he had basic control carefully enlarging his use of
levancy was easy. He got a feel for his levantic limits: how much he could
channel before being at risk of passing out, or worse, simply channeling so
much levancy that he died of overusing it.

Finally Mivoen declared Bob to be ready to face the leviathan. "Go. And
remember, control is more important than raw power. Think instead of trying a
brute-force solution."

"Thank you Mivoen," Bob said honestly, "I will".

Mercury had recently returned from a trip where he had gotten an item that
allowed them to breath under water, although they hopefully wouldn't need these
as they would be engaging the leviathan at the interface between the ocean and
the sky. Mercury had acquired some extremely powerful diamas infused weapons.
The plan was for Bob to provide the main attack, which would give the others a
chance to damage the leviathan with their swords.

Now that Bob was pretty talented with storm levancy they were able to quickly
travel to the leviathan's waters, flying through the air, held up by Bob.

At last, they confronted the leviathan.
"I am come to rob you of your key." Bob shouted, his voice enlarged by levancy,
even travelling under the water to where the leviathan was residing.
"Relinquish it now, or you shall perish!"

Booming laughter sounded from underneath the water, and something enormous rose
from the waters.

The leviathan was scaly and green, and looked fairly menacing, complete with red eyes.

Bob engaged the Leviathan, throwing bolts of lightning, and searing fireballs.
The leviathan laughed absorbing the hits as if they were nothing, and
swam towards Bob's floating form.

*That's not good* Bob thought. He threw more power at the leviathan, but to no
avail. *Well hopefully I'm at least distracting it. Maybe Mercury's weapons
will work better against it.*

After a while he saw Mercury, Bucky, and Azeala sneaking up on the leviathan.
However the leviathan saw him looking at them, and probably heard them too. The leviathan turned on them and was about to eat them. 

"Nooooooo!!!" Bob shouted. He closed his eyes and thought of the leviathan exploding, miniature fire implanted in a lattice underneath its skin. He was about to release this attack, when he remembered Mivoen's words. "Think. Control is more important than raw power."

He dispelled his attack. It would've killed him, and likely his friends also,
if he had actually done it.

The leviathan swallowed Mercury whole.

*But then what do I do?* Bob thought desperately. Then he saw it. The elegant
hidden solution. You didn't need an equal number of cards in each stack for
them to have the same number of face up cards. You didn't even have to be able
to look at the cards, or feel them. You didn't need to know how many cards you
had total. You just had to know how many face up cards there were.

He flipped a card. He launched himself at the leviathan, shooting out of his
safe perch in the sky to engage the beast. It put him in great danger. But it
didn't matter. He was playing for Bucky and Azeala's lives. Maybe for all the
countless lives of everyone that hoped and dreamed for release from Malimost's
iron hard rule. 

He landed on the sea dragon's head, and channeled a burst of lightning directly
into it. The leviathan roared in anger, and reared back from almost eating
Bucky. It reared back, throwing Bob off, and then sought him out and his head
shot forward to eat Bob. Rather than dodge, Bob accelerated himself towards the
oncoming head, preparing a devastating bolt of lightning. At the last moment
the leviathan realized what Bob was doing and his eyes shone with fear. But of
course, its course had been set, there was no opposing its vast momentum now.

Bob released the super concentrated bolt of lightning just he entered the leviathan's mouth, and it created a small hole in the leviathan's skull.

Bob felt the leviathan fall slack, and topple over into the water. Bob put on his breathing under water mask, and extracted himself from the leviathan's maw.

He swam to the leviathan's lair, where he found the key they had been searching
for. 

Then he swam back to the surface. 

"You saved us Bob" Bucky said. "I knew you could do it."

There was an internal silence in Bob's mind as he waited for his cynical
internal monologue to deny that Bucky could have possibly known Bob would risk
himself when Bob didn't even plan to himself. It didn't come.

"I believe you" Bob whispered.

**To Be Continued...**
