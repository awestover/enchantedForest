Epilogue

Characters (in order of levantic abilities): 
  - Jumpydude: charming, deceptive
  - Malimost: Power-hungry, dark levancy
  - Bob: skeptical, angst, paranoid, pessimistic, occasional happy moments/humor to provide contrast
  - Rand: Wise
  - Nodnull: Malimost's human champion
  - Mivoen: Bitter (shark bit his right leg off), prosthetic leg -> reluctant to teach bob -> protecting people while fighting the shark -> easy to hate, make bob do hard stuff that's good for him
  - Azalea (weak levantic powers): descendant of rand, worships him, cares for the "cause"

  - Mercury: sarcastic, direct. Mercury's "life debt" to Azeala: he was trapped in a burning house because something fell on his chest, (from which he suffered permenant damage: hence he has trouble hiking, and a weird laugh) and she got him out of it. Just burning for no special reason. 
  - Buchanan: optimistic, loyal

Magic system: 
  - Levancy
  - Diamas: drink it / channel levancy through weapons made out of it
  - power corruption for the sword of amplification (amplify powers or decrease your powers)



# Arc Ideas:
Bob is angry and devestated because of the destruction of his village, yet he
does not believe that he has the power to oppose Malimost, and is very scared
to do so. Buchannan is comitted to opposing Malimost, specifically with the
goal of making the world a better place for other people, and is not scared to
make personal sacrifices. Buchannan believes in the prophecy foretelling that Bob
will save people from Malimost; he has been told this prophecy and many hopeful
heroic stories since being a youth. Bob is highly skeptical of the prophecy,
and skeptical in general too. He goes along with the quest because of multiple
pressures, and selfishness. He feels that he has no alternative, but does not
care about defeating Malimost, only about securing his own safety, although he
does care about Bucky, and is greatly saddened by the fate of his village.
Over the course of their journeys Bob will come to resepect Buchannan and
develop hope and a sense of purpose in concurring Malimost that makes personal
sacrifices endurable. 

- Bob arc: reluctant, scared, selfish, skeptic  --> gains trust, becomes selfless, optimistic, willing to sacrifice, brave
- Buchanan: has most of the good traits already, has some flaws too, e.g. too ready to charge into battle. his death is catalyst for Bob
