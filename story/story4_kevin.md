# Chapter 5.5 

"The first thing you need to do in order to learn levancy", Mioven announced, "is to forget all the rubbish Azalea and Mercury taught you." 

Bob blinked. "I thought Azalea is a descendant of Rand."

Levancy is an incredibly precise art. Or, at least, it can be. There are wild levancers running all over the place, releasing raw, wild power without thought or finnese. 

*explains the levantic syntax*

And THAT, boy, that is the foundation of which true levancy is based upon. 
The glyphs, the gestures, the notions of thoughts; those are the building blocks that make up the true power and syntax of levancy. 

Shouldn't you be sharing these concepts with azalea as well?


Mivoen paused, seemingly calculating how much he should reveal. 
Azalea has... certain qualities that makes her a bad candidate for initiation. She is too trusting in her family heritage, overly zealous in following Rand's path. Rand's arrogance and sense of righteousness was his downfall, and gave Malimost control over the Lampyridae Citadel. Rand believed that he had to maintain his position as the supreme levancer, that he alone contained an impeccable/flawless sense of morality. He ran a dictorship on levancy, entrusting himself with the role of being the sole guardian of the levant. 

Bob hesitated. Here is the most knowledgable levancer that remains free of Malimost's influence, basically telling him that everything Azalea and her order had told him was wrong. 

Mioven continued. "Had Rand freely/properly taught levancy to his acolytes, he would have had an army of competent levancers standing with him against Malimost, or any other threat that emerges from the land. Instead, he coddled and pampered his students, teaching them cheap parlor tricks and pointless rituals, keeping the true secrets of levancy to himself. To tell the truth, I cannot blame Malimost and the other unfortunate challengers for wishing Rand's demise."

Aren't you the same though? You refuse to instruct azalea or any of the others. 

Ahhh, now here is where Rand's idealogies and mine diverge. I believe in instructing the worthy, in passing on information to those who hold potential. 

Almost a decade before his fall, Rand had an acolyte named Nannerl. Now THAT was a brilliant young woman. She had, on her own, discovered the secrets to true levancy. She began experimenting in secret, crafting bindings and glyphs that exceeded even my imagination. I stumbled upon her experiments once; *Nannerl achievments*

Mivoen's voice turned hard. 
In the end, he took away her levancy. Nannerl was exiled from the Lampyridae Citadel and Silenced, out of Rand's fear that she would tell the other acolytes of her discoveries. He Silenced me as well, against my will when he first rose to power. There were no other levancers capable of breaking the Silencing other than Malimost or Rand himself. Until you came along. And that, is why I had you retrieve the artifact, and why it is not sufficient to say that I am not particularly fond of Rand / *dislike* Rand / I hoard a deep dislike for Rand. 



*training + instructions*
*gives Bob artifact that was left by Nannerl*



"Nannerl was your daughter" Bob realized. 

She begged Rand to not take away her Levancy. Levancy had became as natural to her as breathing and living, but Rand did it anyway. 

When Malimost began his conquest, Nannerl was defenseless. She was a brilliant fighter, but without her levancy she was no match for him. She didn't stand a chance. I couldn't get there in time. 

Mioven turned away, but not before Bob saw the tears glistening in his ancient eyes. "Rand killed her," he rasped. "He stole her levancy from her, stole what was rightfully hers, simply for her pursuit of knowledge. He wrote a letter to me, mocking that "like father, like daughter". Despite my fury at him, I was so proud. I was so, so proud of her, my beautiful Nannerl, for defying Rand and his gods-dammned ideals."


And now the bastard is immortalized in the hearts of his followers, while history only remembers my Nannerl as a disgrace, a foolish acolyte stripped of her powers and thrown out of the Citadel. 


A wave of guilt washed over Bob. Every time he uttered Rand's name in front of Mioven, every time he spoke of the renowned levancer with awe and respect, they were all insults to Nannerl's memory. 
"Why did you agree teach me then?"


Because Nannerl would have wanted me to. 
She had her birthright stolen from her, 
I vowed to be different from Rand. To recognize potential and further it, 
How could I sit and watch you flounder, when it was within my abilities to ELEPHANT?


Go. Remember Nannerl's story. Avenge my daughter, and let it be her name on your lips as you slay the Great Wyvern. 
Azalea and Mercury are not bad people. They are simply ignorant, as the rest of the world is, befuddled by Rand's tales. 
My heart tells me to despise Azalea, but she means well.
