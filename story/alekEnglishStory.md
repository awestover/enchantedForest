# Plot Idea:
Bob is angry and devestated because of the destruction of his village, yet he
does not believe that he has the power to oppose Malimost, and is very scared
to do so. Buchannan is comitted to opposing Malimost, specifically with the
goal of making the world a better place for other people, and is not scared to
make personal sacrifices. Buchannan believes in the prophecy foretelling that Bob
will save people from Malimost; he has been told this prophecy and many hopeful
heroic stories since being a youth. Bob is highly skeptical of the prophecy,
and skeptical in general too. Over the course of their journeys Bob will come
to resepect Buchannan and develop hope and a sense of purpose in concurring
Malimost that makes personal sacrifices endurable. 

TL;DR
- Bob arc: reluctant, scared, selfish, skeptic  --> gains trust, becomes selfless, optimistic, willing to sacrifice, brave
- Buchanan: has most of the good traits already, has some flaws too, e.g. too ready to charge into battle


# Start Story

Bob could hardly believe what had happene to his life. Just a single week
earlier his only concern in life was the well being of his herd of llama's, and
when he would get back to the village to see his family, and his friend Sarah.
Now, a single week later, everyone he had ever known, with the sole exception
of Buchannan, was dead. Burned to a crisp by Malimost's dark fire levancy. Or
more likely some of his bound servants, Bob doubted that Malimost would deem
his small village important enough to personally destroy for whatever
unexplained offense had led to its destruction.

He still felt numb every time he thought about the destruction of his village.
*How could this happen?* This village was all that he knew! Bob was completely 
shook and at a loss for how to move on with his life. On the one hand he
clearly could not go back to his peaceful, existence as a llama herder; a
blissfully uneventful existence that was not boring for lack of events but
rather pleasant. No Bob could never return to this idyllic way of living. The 
obvious reason for this was that he and Buchanan had been forced to abandon
their llamas in their flight from the minions of Malimost that they found
ravaging the village. Furthermore, it simply wasn't safe. However Bob
desparately wanted to return to this existence. He did not feel, as Buchanan
foolishly seemed to that the destruction of his village meant that they had to
fight against Malimost. What a ludicrous idea! Bob inernally chided his overly
hopeful friend. Bob had about as much chance of decreasing how terrible
Malimost's rule was as he had of winning the anual village swimming contest,
and Bob coudln't swim.

*Eventually*, Bob supposed, *I will have to seek out some other location, and
somehow aquire more animals to shepherd or something*. Maybe I could be a
farmer? However, at the moment Bob was very far from anywhere where he could
do this. And Bob wasn't going to abandon Buchanan, he'd convince him to come to.
Buchanan was sane, he'd listen to reason, Bob hoped. 

This plan relied on Bob and Buchanan not dying in the immediate future however,
and death recently had become a prospect which was drearily high probability.
Memories of Bob's fight against the unicorn haunted him. And yet there was also
a surpsiging spark of excitement during the battle: when Bob had realized that
he could really naturally channel the Levant. The feel of his magical cane
turned staff in his hand had been reasuring, a firm pillar admist the chaos of battle.
He would like to experience it again, although of course not in a dangerous situation.

Buchanan walked over. "Hey Bob! You just get up?" Buchanan amicabally said,
standing over Bob as Bob, groaning, finally got up at the sound of Buchanan's foot steps.

"It's impossible to tell when it's day and when it's night in these blasted
caverns" Bob complained, "and I'm exhausted from my battles".

"Well you are the chosen one! Better get used to battles and exhaustion and the
like." Buchanan said, in an air much too casual for Bob's liking.

*Oh, not this prophecy nonsense again* Bob internally groaned. Buchnaan was
obsessed with this prophecy that he had apparently heard many times when he was
young: that a green eyed llama herder, the first levancer among his people,
would suffer a great tradgedy and go on to exact retribution on Malimost.
Or something. In truth the prophecy was incredibly vague, and muddled through
constant retelling via the oral tradition.
Somehow, Buchanan believed that Bob's victory over the unicorn in
addition to the other evebts that have transpired proved that Bob was some how
special and destind to save peopel form Malimost's oppressive rule. 

This of course was utter nonsense. His newfound levantic powers were of course very surprising.
However it was very unlikely that Bob would become a strong levanter, and
completely laughable to speak of him opposing Malimost, who was a more powerful levancer than even the legandary Rand!
No one better than Malimost had challenged him in a thousand years, not that
Malimost gave levancers much chance: Malimost made sure that levancers were
bound to him as early as possible, or killed if they would not consent to be bound with his oathstone.
There were always rogue levanters who were able to hide, but these were insignificant flies compared to Malimost.

No, Bob was not destined for great power. 
Usually when Levancy first started showing up in the children in a new region the levanters were incredibly weak.
No one really knew how new aspects of the Levant were created. The Levant was
clearly tied in an intricate way to the geography of a region: the strength of each type of
Levancy that levanters could channel depended greatly on where they were. Only the most powerful levancers could 
even channel levancy of a different type than the source that occupied their region. 
When a source of Levant came to a new region some children -- it wasn't clear
how they was determined, although some hypothesized that the children had to
have been somehow "exposed" directly to the new source of Levancy -- would develop Levantic abilities. 

Maybe in some time long gone Bob's powers might have been a blessing that gave
him great joy. Now however 
they were a mark over his head. It would eb exceedingly difficult to find a way
to live the quie life that he desired, as if any of Malimost's minions found
out about him he woudl be hunted down.

Now that Bob had defeated the unicorn the caverners had promised that they would help him and Buchanan.
It was time to go see what plan they had in mind.

"Let's go talk to Azeala and Mercury now that we've killed their dang unicorns.
" Bob said, pointedly ignoring Buchannan's comment about his supposed destiny.

"You're not even going to wait for breakfast?" Buchannan laughed.

"No, I want to get this over with as soon as possible", Bob said seriously "we
can eat once we're on the road to safety, and once they've explained why we had
to risk our necks to kill those unicorns."

"Bob, you know that those unicorns were probably somewhat responsible for the
desolation of our village..." Buchanan, said, sounding surprised at Bob's
anger.

"I don't freaking care!" Bob screamed. "The majority of the world is an
accomplice of Malimost! Any other minion could have destroyed the village for a
reason as arbitrary as whatever the unicorns had. The destoryed village is a
sunk cost. There's no fixing it. Nothing we can do will bring them back. It'll
just make us join them in the ranks of the dead. And don't you start about that
corroded prophecy and hope for a better life for the rest of the inhabitatnts
of this earth and about how I'm being selfish. I'm simply sensible and you know
it!"

Buchannan looked somewhat put out by this. But it of course wasn't in his
nature to verbally argue with Bob about this. Nor was it his nature to be
swayed from his foolish beliefs in prophecies. Most of the time Bob 
thought that these traits were fairly admirable in Buchannan. But 
an optimist only survived when times were good. In bad times optimism was often
fatal.

Bob quickly rolled up his gear into his pack and he and Buchanan walked down
the cavern paths in silence: Bob in agry silence, Buchanan in contemplative
silence.

They reached the glowing central cavern and Bob was again shocked by its
magnificence. In contrast to the rest of the caverns this cavern was intensely
brightly lit, by torches covering the walls and large fire pits with roaring
bonfires. The seeming waste of this light would have bothered him if he didn't
know that this wood did not release flames that burned hot, the flames emitted
electromagnetic radiation in a remarkably specific subset of the visible
spectrum: namely the emitted almost soley visible light. Furthermore the wood
had remarkably high energy density. The combined effect was that this wood
could glow a vibrarnt bright white for a very long time. The flames served a
dual purpose: to provide light, and to provide a reminder that the people in
this cavern resisted Malimost, and had powerful Levanters, for example a master
of plant levancy who was willing to set up this light supply for them.

Stalagmites glistened above, the light reflecting off of their many surfaces.
On close inspection this room was similarly wet to the other caverns, but this
place felt much less dreary because of the light.

Buchannan spotted Mercury and Azeala waiting at the booth where they had
advertised that they would be waiting. They looked incredibly anxious, and
clearly had not yet spotted Bob and Buchanan.

Right as he was about to start walking towards them however, he had a very rational thought. 
"Wait Bucky" he whispered, "can we talk about this first?"

"What? Is something wrong Bob?" Buchanan said, showing his characteristic look of concern.

"It's just, well, we didn't really understand how dangerous it was going to be to face that unicorn. Honestly we could have died."

"Well, yeah" Buchannan admitted reluctantly. "But doesn't it feel good to
defeat them? We made the world a safer place..." Buchannan trailed off when he
saw Bob's expression of disgust. "ok, but that was a one time thing, and I'm
sure this unicorn horn is of vital importance to them", he said gesturing to
his pack which contained their hard won unicorn horn. "They'll help us now".
"We can go somewhere safe, and you will have time to learn about your new
Levantic abilities. Then when you're ready the prophecy implies that you will
be presented some opportunity to overthrow Malimost and make the world a better
place!" Buchanan said enthusiastically.

"Imporant opportunities never present themselves, they only come after intense
personal effort", Bob derisively said, although the affect was diminished by it
being said in a whisper. 

"Listen Buchannan though, this prophecy buisness is exactly what I'm worried
about. They, like you, seem to believe I probably have an important part in
their so-called battle against Malimost. Even if they aren't deluded by this
prophecy they know that I'm a Levancer. I don't think they are going to let me
go off into some quiet place. I think they're going to push me to go on a quest
to defeat Malimost."

Buchannan sighed. "I doubt it. But if it's true I'll stand by you: you
shouldn't be forced to go on a quest before you're ready."

"No one is ever ready for something that they cannot do yet" Bob thought. But
he decided not to point this out verbally. "Thanks Bucky! I knew I could count on you." he said instead.

Bob and Buchanan walked across the large carervn to the booth where Mercury and Azeala were waiting.
Their faces lit up in what Bob thought looked susplicously like surprise at seeing him and Buchanan alive.

"Did you get me the unicorn horn I needed" Mercury asked, sounding pleased.

"Yes I've got it right here!" Buchanan said happily, moving to pull it out.

"Not right here..." Azeala said. "Let's have this conversation somewhere a bit
more private. I think that a lot of things about this shouldn't become common
knowledge. These people are good people but the only true way to contain a secret
is to never spread it in the first place."

Rather than placate Bob as Azeala might have guessed this would, the attempts
at greater secrecy worried Bob. It reeked of further plotting to Bob, and he
did not like the sound of that. Furthermore the idea that secrets were not sage
even in this stronghold was greatly disturbing, not in the least because Bob
had kind of naively taken for granted that he was not being spied on. Bob wasn't
very used to this whole being rogue thing.

Bob reluctantly followed after Azeala, Mercury and Buchanan into a tunnel
offshooting from the main cavern. After walkign for a very short while
they came to a small enclosed room. They walked in and Mercury bolted closed the door.
"We are totally secure now" said Azeala. "This room has been Levantically
soundproofed, no-one, even with levancy could possibly hear our discussion now".

Bob snorted derisively. He sincerely doubted that the security placed on this
room was truly unbreakable to a levantic measure.

"Don't believe me, do you?" Azeala smirked at his chagrined expression when he
realized that she had heard him. The existence of one-way functions with
backdoors is not so implausible, it is in fact the basis for this really cool
algorithm in theoretical comptuer science called RSA.

"Yeah", Mercury chimed in, "or for an even simpler example just think about the
problem of factoring a semiprime in the cases where you have no information and
the case where you are given a prime divisor of the semiprime!"

"Um ok" Bob said. "It just seems hard to do that with like sound waves."
Like sure you could encrypt a digital signal, but we have an analog time series here.

"just because you cannot understand it right now doesn't mean that it's false."
Azeala repreimanded. "If you were thinkign less skeptically you would realize
that you actaully understand very littel abtou Levancy so it is entirely
plausible that you would not hte mechanism by which it works"

"Althoguh truth be told neither of us have any idea how it works either" Mercury admitted after a pause.

"ok, to buisness. You can get out the unicorn horn now Buchanan" Azeala said in a buisness manner.

Buchanan pulled out the unicorn horn and handed it to Azeala.

"It's really true." Azeala whispered in wonder, clearly speaking only to
herself. "The prophecy, everything that we believed in".

"Enough!" Bob shouted. "You can find another poor fellow to trick into
fulfilling your dang prohpecy. I won't be fooled though. The whole endeavor is hopeless".


Heedless of Bob, Azeala chanted
> "The chosen one shall come forth from the llama lands, and have eyes as green as the grass that the llama is grazed on
> a humble llama shepherd by birth, and yet destined to shake the earth
> the one will be known by their green eyes and the fact that if they beat a unicorn in battle and take its horn then the horn will turn black
> the one will face great tribulations e.g. getting their village burned down, and will take a path either to eradicate evil or become it"
<!-- make this a bit more prophecy-y -->

Bob was shook by the power of her voice, but shook it off, there was no such
thing as prophecy. Azeala had just practiced theatrical skills. It was easy to
impress a poor llama herder. Before Bob could object further Mercury pulled
another horn, this one a pure white. Not the beuatiful pearly white of a
typical unicorn horn, but rather a blinding white light that almost hurt to
look at, in the same way that the unicorn horn that Bob had collected from the
unicorn had turned darker than the darkest night.

"This is the fabled horn created by the legendary levanter Rand shortly before
his death. If you'll remember Rand was actually the oracle that initially issued the 
very prophecy that you are destined to fulfil. Rand had no idea why he was
making this horn at the time that he made it, but made it because of an
impression that it would be important in the future.

And lucky that he did, he died shortly after making it. It has long been
conjectured that this horn had some relation to the prophecy, it is too much of
a coincidence that a black horn appears in the prohpecy, an obvious dual to the
white horn supposedly created by Rand. 
I say supposedly because the horn was lost after Rand died, many people assumed
that it burned with the rest of Rand's famed tower of Levancy and the artifacts
that Malimost burned there.
If not, it seemed almost certian that the horn had come into posssesion of
Malimost, he colllected nearly all the magical artifacts.

However, we found this horn lying on the ground somewhere recently. 
And then we ran into you.
We had to know if the prohpecy was true.
We know it was usper dangerous to send you, a barely awakened levancer, to face a unicorn.
But we had to. Had to know.
And now? It appears that we were correct.

Most people seem to believe that when the chosen one wields both horns and
shouts copolla then somethign magical will happnen, which will be critical
towards bringing about the downfal of Malimost.

So hwo abtou you try it?

Bob was totally blow away. "No way" he tried to object, but it sounded
half-hearted even to himself.

"You've got nothign to lose if this is all a prophecy dreamed up by a 
17 year old at 2:13 AM with a messed up sleep schedule." Azeala noted rationally.

"OK, I'll do it" Bob whispered.

Azeala and Mercury reverently bestowed the horns to Bob, the deep black horn to
the left hand and the pure white horn to the right hand.

Bob held them apprehensively. Then, after looking to Buchanan who vigorously
affirmed that he thought this was a great idea with a nod of his head, Bob
touched the horns together and whispered "Coppolla"

Then a holographic recroding of Rand emerged from in front of the horns.

Well hello there my friend! I have no idea what a situation you are in, but I
know that it will surely be very dire, hence I was instructed to make these
precautions. It seems that if must record this something bad is going to happen to me.
However the time frame for this is not clear, so I fear not for myself. I
believe that I will likely die a peaceful death one day, when I am ready. More, I
fear for you and your fellow citizens in whatever trying time that you live. 
Because of how hard your time will likely be, I have made this provision to help you.

I have keyed this recording to your hand: in order to be seeing this recording
you must fit the description giving in the prophecy. The white unicorn horn is
keyed to your humble upbringing as a lammaa herder, while the black unicorn
horn is keyed to your great potential levantic power.
United together the white horn that I created, and the black horn that you must
have created by defeating a unicorn with your levantic powers, will, by the
levancy that I have worked on my white horn, create this recording for you.

You might wonder how I am protecting this information from getting into the
wrong hands, for a powerful malicious levancer could equally well defeat a
unicorn.

The protection is in the white unicorn horn. I won't get into any details, but
it would basically incinerate you if you were seeking the secret that I have hidden 
out of desire for personal power or gain.

***some other stuff***
if you gather some keys you can get a really powerful thing that even I didnt use for some reason (worried that it corrutps? could this thing be jumpydude???)
so get the keys


***ok so somehow we have to motivate getting keys to get some artifact thing that is useful for defeating malimost***

Buchanan: ok bob sorry but looks like we got to
Bob: no

something happens that basically forces him, or i guess he could chose. probably not ready for this yet in his arc tho. 
Bob: rip


- storm
  - Leviathan (skull makes you fireproof, able to enter fire area after this)
  - get key
- plants
  - get key
  - Buchanan dies
