# by kevin. TL;DR: Bob has armor, and is sarcastic

Bob stood next to the stone pillar with a grin. Mercury had outfitted him with
an emerald trenchcoat, with arm guards and a light metal breastplate
underneath. He had a bandolier stocked with potions and throwing knives, in
addition to two long diamas daggers strapped to his legs. After hearing about
the details of the kirin battle, the supplier decided that Bob would be better
off lightly armored, to fit his fast-paced fighting style.

Buchanan was dressed in a similar fashion, and given a crossbow to provide support from the sidelines. 

"Bruh. This. Is so epic. We are... help me out here."

"We, slayers of the kirin, servants of Lampyris and bane of Malimost, are about
to embark on a glorious journey, and the bards shall sing of our names for
years to come," Bob whispered dramatically. 

They both snickered, while Azalea shook her head in exasperation.
