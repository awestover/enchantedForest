Upon exiting the portal, the group encounters Nodnull and his troops


Azalea: You need to have more focus, like Mivoen taught you. Meditate, breathe, blah blah blah

It's not just that. I can *feel* all this... all this potential *burning* inside me, but I don't know how to access it! Bob cried. There has to be more than this. 

He felt foolish voicing this out loud. It made him sound like he was making excuses as to why his prophesized powers were weaker than expected. But Bob knew that lack of raw power wasn't the problem; he feel the vast basin of power churning within him, and could access it without any issues. It was the lack of finesse and technique that bothered him, like he was hurling levancy the way one would throw rocks. 

---------------------------------------------

*Meets victoria and gains new weapon*
Bucky drew his weapon. "Dragon!" he cried
"Don't attack! She's friendly! Her name is bubbles."
Bubbles barked. 
"Did she... did she just bark?"
"You named your fire-breathing dragon 'bubbles'"

No! I did not do xxx!
why do you always assume that I do the worst things?
I mean, okay, to be fair I do a lot of weird shit, but no. 

Bob made a feral grin. 
Uh-oh
what. 
He's making that face again. Bob only smiles like that when he's thinking of doing something extremely reckless. 

*bob gets his ass kicked by Nodnull and his legion*

---------------------

A hooded figure materialized out of the shadows, leaping towards Nodnull's legion with supernatural grace. They drew two blades mid-air, one glistening obsidian, the other translucent white, burning in a dark shade of lilac instead of the usual levantic aura. Whirling the daggers, the figure sliced through the legion with incredible precision, bringing down opponents with a few swift strikes. The hood fell off, revealing a young man with delicate features and pale hair. 

Without any visible moment from the man, a pentagon flared beneath his feet, wreathing him in shadows. They adhered to him like armor, binding themselves to the linen robes he wore. He flipped his blades again, this time stronger, faster, blazing even brighter than before. The unidentified man grinned, feral and unnerving, filled with brutality and savage delight. His expression promised pain and misery to whomever dared challenge him. 

Bob sucked in a breath; he could *feel* the immense levantic power emanating from the man, almost overwhelming him even at a distance. The man was undoubtedly a levancer, and yet it was levancy like he had never seen before. Nodnull's skill with levancy was already mind-blowing, and surpassed Mivoen by leagues. But this... this was on the level of the gods. 

Oblivious to the vast surges of levancy surrounding the man, Bucky was about to shout a warning as Nodnull crept behind the mysterious levancer, but he simply slashed his blades in Nodnull's direction without even turning his head. Nodnull flew back, cursing. Shadows twisted and bound Nodnull as he crashed into a tree, as if they had a mind of their own. Meanwhile, the Levancer continued his relentless assault against Nodnull's men, an unforgiving dance of steel and levancy. When Nodnull rose to his feet again, the man had single-handedly annihilated his entire legion. 

"Kienan", Nodnull growled. Azalea's face paled at the mention of the name. 
Kienan sheathed his blades and lifted his arm. The back of his hand glowed, dotted with his levancer's mark. 
His fingers traced the air, leaving markings that scorched the space before him. The shadows binding Nodnull dispelled. 

Tell Malimost that he will pay. That we will come for him, with every last shred of levancy within us. His era has come to an end, and a new one will be borne from his death. 

Nodnull glared at Kienan, then leapt onto his mount and fled. 




The man walked up to Bob and the others. At a closer distance, Bob noticed that he had pointed ears, and one eye that was a vibrant violet, the other metallic silver. 

Bucky stared at the man with accusation and disgust. "You killed them."

"My deepest apologies," the man replied in a smooth, amused voice. "I did not realize that I was to invite them over for tea instead."

Bob was still in awe at what Kienan had done. He had wiped out Nodnull and his legion without even breaking a sweat. "Azalea... why not just have him defeat Malimost instead of me?"

"Rand mentioned Kienan in the Lampyridae Chronicles. He wrote that..." Azalea faltered, but forced herself meet Kienan's face. "He wrote that you were not to be trusted. That you would attempt to corrupt us with your heretical methods."

"After just encountering a situation where conventional, <rand-religion-following> methods failed, I would have expected one to be more open-minded towards accepting novel ideas. And to answer Bob's inquiry, us fae cannot wield Paragon, a weapon designed for humans. In terms of raw power, I will admit that I am no match for Malimost, and without the dragon-slayer sword boosting my powers, I have little chance of besting him. What I can do, however, is to offer our human champion here training." 

"I see great potential in you, boy, and despite the incompetent instructors you have had, there remains hope for you."

*azalea and the others refuse to let Kienan teach Bob because of rumors in the levantic chronicles*

"Bob. Bob, listen. Kienan killed his own daughter. His. Own. Daughter. The dual blades he holds? Those are Urim and Thummim. They are *wet* with the blood of his own child. you have to stay away from him."

*azalea starts rambling about Kienan's crimes and gets cut short by Bucky*

"Don't go."
Bob stared at Bucky. Azalea and Mercury could recite miles of evidence from the Lampyridae Chronicles, and he would still be tempted to follow Kienan. But for Bucky... for his friend, he would stay.

"I can't."

Kienan smiled sadly/in defeat/defeatedly. Bob thought he looked like someone who has been struck down multiple times, by life and grief and rumors. He wondered if he had made the right choice. 

"One day. One day, when the time is right, come find me."
"For now, you have your own journey to undergo. "
*reveals terioth's weakness*

He melted into the shadows, and was gone. 



-------------------------------

*fights the terioth guardian*
*Bucky dies, from the terioth + traps Malimost set*

Bucky wouldn't have wanted you to do this. 
Bucky is *dead*. He is *dead*, and it is *my* gods-damned fault, because my levancy wasn't enough to save him. 
He would want me to stay away from Kienan? WELL I WANT HIM TO BE ALIVE. WE CAN'T ALL GET WHAT WE WANT. 

Bob forced himself to draw in a deep breath. "And face it," he said. "I couldn't even take on Nodnull and his legion. How am I supposed to defeat Malimost? Meditate until I transcend into godhood?"

"You have to trust Rand. You have to trust that Paragon is going to be enough to help you overpower Malimost." Azalea whispered. "You can't do this. You're Rand's heir. He left everything for you. You're the hero everyone's been waiting decades for, and going to Kienan goes against everything he's ever taught us."

"I am not *heir* to that sodden old man, nor anyone else," he spat.
"I am my own person, and I will forge my legacy out of blood and violence if I have to."
If learning from Kienan is what it takes to get revenge for Bucky, then so be it.
